<h2>Here's a game I made.</h2>
<h3>You have to play with another player on the same computer, you use the arrow keys to move the black player and the asdw keys to move the red player (a for left, s for down, w for up, and d for right). The goal of the game is to pick up the crown in the mmiddle and hold it for as long as possible since the other player is trying to steal it. Every second you hold the crown your score of 1000 goes down and whoevers score reaches 0 first wins. Simply run into the enemy player to steal the crown and have fun.</h3>
